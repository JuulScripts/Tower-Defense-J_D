# Tower Defense J_D
Zombie Defense: City Siege
Welcome to J_D's zombie defense:, a tower defense game where your goal is simple: protect the city from waves of relentless zombies and of course have tons of fun!. 

🧟 About the Game
In this project you're tasked with strategically placing defense units to stop the zombies from destroying the city. Each wave gets a bit harder.

🛠️ Easy-to-Extend Unit System (For Developers)
The game includes a modular system for creating and customizing new towers, designed with flexibility in mind. If you want to add your own units, here’s how:

Start with the TowerHolder prefab – drop your own rig or model into it.

If your unit has special effects or behaviors, add an EffectScript component to the TowerHolder.

In the Inspector, look under the Effects & Targeting section.

Scroll to the desired GameObject and select the function you want to trigger when the tower attacks.

This setup makes it quick and easy to prototype new unit types without digging deep into code.

💡 Inspiration
The idea started after spotting an asset on the Unity Asset Store. It sparked the whole concept and grew into what you're seeing now.

🎓 School Project
This game was made as part of a school assignment, combining game design, coding, and systems thinking into one fun funny package.
